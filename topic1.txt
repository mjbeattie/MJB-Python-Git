Protecting data is no different than protecting wealth. We don't leave our homes and cars open for anyone to access, use or abuse. Similarly, we need to protect our data and electronic documents and take measures to protect them. Devices and computers should be password protected with multiple layers of security so that any passerby is not able to access the device without even trying. Documents should not be stored on flash or pen drives without encrypting the data and access should be allowed only after user is authenticated properly. File naming convention should not be obvious. A cryptic naming convention should be established so that if someone gets hold of your device for a short time, they should not be able to figure out what that file contains just by looking at the file name. One example of an obvious file name that gives away its contents is Taxes016.pdf, or paystub.doc, etc.
