What options you have to keep documents secure and private depend greatly on the level of privacy and security the information contained within the documents requires, which is why governments and private companies often have varying levels of classifying documents such as the common top secret, secret, confidential, unclassified schema.Encryption should be used, though what encryption that cannot be brute forced is a moving target as computer speeds constantly increase, so where 64bit encryption may have been enough a decade ago, 512bit may be required now. Given quantum computing seems to be on the horizon, it could make current encryption methods obsolete depending on how things progress.Keeping the document on an non-networked device could also be a requirement if it is for your eyes only and doesn't need wider distribution. If the document needs distribution then you have to consider encryption in motion standards, VPNs, and authentication/authorization systems.This doesn't even touch on physical security or operating system and application system security which would also have to be considered.
